# CS180 Programming Assignment Skeleton Code

Welcome to the CS180 project skeleton code repository!

This repository contains the skeleton code for the CS180 project, guided by Matthew Ferland and coded by TA: Yadi Cao. The project aims to help you learn how to solve DP problems.

## Getting Started

To begin working on the project, you can clone this repository to your local machine.

**Recommendation:** Alternatively, you can fork this project and develop it in your own repository. This way, you can easily merge any potential updates from my side.

## Notes

This repository may receive updates from the course instructor or TAs to fix bugs or improve the skeleton code. Hence, forking it into your own repository is very convenient later on.

Happy coding!
